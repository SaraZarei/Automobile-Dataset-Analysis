- Pre processing data in python
- Dealing missing values
- Data formatting
- Data normalization
- Binning

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

- Descriptive statistics
- Groupby
- Analysis of variance
- Correlation
- Correlation stats

**Model Development**

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression

**Model Review and Evaluation**

- Regression Plots
- Distribution Plots
